        <p class="para"><u>History</u></p><br><blockquote>
        <p class="para1"><br>
            The history of anime goes back to 1907. At this time, many Japanese artists were influenced by Western animation and decided to create specific national content for Japan. This was very difficult because materials were expensive and Japan suffered several economic crises due to natural disasters and later because of WW2.</p>
            
            <p class="para1"><br>In the 1940s, Japan premiered the first animated film which was sponsored by the government. When the war ended, over the years the manga (Japanese comics) were distributed to the population. They served as a distraction from the harsh realities that Japanese people had to face after the war.</p>
            
            <p class="para1"><br>Today there are a plethora of anime titles aimed at all types of audiences, and it has grown to become one of the most important export products for the Japanese economy. Anime's characteristics are having real-feeling plots, full of emotions and drama. In some cases, strong exaggeration of the actions performed by the characters is used. Common anime tends to have characters with large, oval eyes, outrageous haircuts, and very humanized bodies.</p>
            
            <p class="para1"><br>Anime should not be taken as being children's entertainment only, it is more to the contrary. Most titles are aimed at a mature audience. There are anime companies that have managed to create content to satisfy both audiences, such as Studio Ghibli, one of the most powerful companies in the world of animation.</p>
        </p>
        <br><p class="para"><u>Types</u></p>
        <p class="para1"><br>
        <u>Shonen</u></p><br>
            <p class="para1">Shonen can be translated to mean few years in English, and refers to a younger male audience. Shonen anime usually look to meet all the interests of younger males. Most of the series feature a young male protagonist. Shonen anime have some of the most popular and well known franchise as they contain a little bit of everything. There's elements of action, adventure, fighting, drama, comedy, and coming of age.</p>
            <br><p class="para1"><br><u>Seinen</u></p><br>
            <p class="para1">Seinen can be translated as young man in English, and targets the young adult or adult male viewers. Seinen anime usually have the same stories and themes as shonen, however are more sophisticated than shonen.They are more violent, sexual, satirical, or psychologically intense and therefore cater to a more mature audience. It is popular with high school teens all the way up to businessmen.</p>
            <br><p class="para1"><br><u>Shoujo</u></p><br>
           <p class="para1">Shoujo is the opposite of shonen, translated in English as young girl. Shoujo focuses more on the interpersonal relationship and romance in the story rather than the fighting and action. The series tend to be more dramatic, but also still include the adventure, comedy and action that are prevalent in shonen. The protagonist of the story is almost always female.</p>
           <br><p class="para1"><br><u>Josei</u></p><br>
           <p class="para1">As shoujo is the counterpart of shonen, josei is the opposite of seinen. Seinen shows are targeted towards adult female viewers and focus more on romance than anything. They usually have a more realistic feel than shoujo and feature adult woman. There are more erotic, intense, and dark subjects than other genres. They are based around everyday normal life, but also have dramatic heavy scenes.</p>
           <br><p class="para1"><br><u>Kodomomuke</u></p><br>
           <p class="para1">Last but not least we have another genre that most have at least seen one show from kodomomuke. Kodomomuke means directed at children in English, and is the only genre suitable for young viewers. They usually are super cute, imaginative, and creative, as well as has a moral message. The shows usually teach children how to be considerate, behave, and follow the right path to life, while still being fun and exciting.</p>
